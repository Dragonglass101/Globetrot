# GlobeTrot

GlobeTrot is an app to help users find people who are most compatible to travel with them on the basis of the percentage similarity of their interests. The user can choose between a wide variety of interests and GlobeTrot will try to find the best suited people who are most compatible to travel with them.

# Motivation

Nowadays, it has become very difficult to find a person who has the time and resources to go out on a trip with you. We have all experienced that it is extremely difficult to plan a trip with friends due to some restrictions (especially in this pandemic situation). Hence, there is a requirement of a method that allows users to travel with other users with same interests.

# Future Scope

Due to lack of time the app could not take its full form, so we plan on doing the follwing additions and changes in the future:
- Increasing the efficiency of the matching algorithm by introducing a rating factor of each user. 
- Expanding the idea from finding one travel partner to finding a group of travellers with similar interests.
- Providing a means of communication in the app itself
- Increasing the list of interests for increasing the efficiency of the algorithm
- Fixing bugs
